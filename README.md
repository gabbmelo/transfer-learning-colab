# A transfer learning project for image classification

This project consists of applying the Transfer Learning method to a Deep Learning network in the Python language within the COLAB environment, as part of the 'BairesDev - Machine Learning Practitioner'  bootcamp [publisehd at the DIO platform](https://web.dio.me/track/coding-the-future-baires-dev-machine-learning-practitioner?tab=about).

As an example, we will use the following project that performs Transfer Learning with the [ImageNet Dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kylemath/ml4a-guides/blob/master/notebooks/transfer-learning.ipynb).
